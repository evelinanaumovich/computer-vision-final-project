## Problem Domain and Brief Problem Description
Our original idea for this final project was to create a computer vision program that would be able to detect the top 2000 words in American Sign Language (ASL). Using a dataset of 12,000 YouTube videos to train our model to accurately interpret ASL signs. The input is a live feed from a simple computer camera, looking for real-time ASL signs, which will then be processed to show a correcsponding text translation. This program could benefit the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by providing real-time translation and improving communication between those that do and no not know sign language.

## High Level Approach

What is the high-level approach that you are taking? What datasets are you using? What makes the approach difficult, or not so difficult? How much data are you using? Are there any problems with that data?

## Results

How do the results relate to alternative approaches to the same problem? Does this “solve” the problem for real use cases, or are there still things needed before your approach is useful?
