## Problem Domain and Brief Problem Description
1-2 paragraphs describing what your goal is (what are the inputs and outputs of the system you are considering), what are example data input and output, and who would care about this problem.

## High Level Approach

What is the high-level approach that you are taking? What datasets are you using? What makes the approach difficult, or not so difficult? How much data are you using? Are there any problems with that data?

## Results

How do the results relate to alternative approaches to the same problem? Does this “solve” the problem for real use cases, or are there still things needed before your approach is useful?
